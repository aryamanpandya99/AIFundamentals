# Markov Decision Processes 

Moving on from graph search algorithms which assume a deterministic view of the world to MDPs that help us model probabilistic results of state-action pairs. 

This repository will contain one basic markov model for which we'll find the optimal policy via value iteration. Next, the model will be hidden to an RL 
agent whose job will be to try and find an estimate for the value function of its policy.
