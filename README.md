# AI Fundamentals

This repository contains implementations of Graph Search algorithms and a linear regression model in C++11 and higher. The implementations were created while following CS221: AI Principles and Techniques from Stanford University on YouTube.

## Graph Search Algorithms
The `GraphSearchAlgorithms` directory contains implementations of the following algorithms:

- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A*
- RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree)

## Machine Learning
The `MachineLearningCPP` directory contains an implementation of linear regression using gradient descent.

## Markov Decision Processes
The `MarkovDecisionProcesses` directory contains code related to Markov Decision Processes.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
