CS221: AI Principles and Techniques

Short projects as I refresh my basic AI techniques and principles. 
As I transition from working on Computer Vision Projects (CS231n, repo ComputerVision) 
to other types of deep learning problems (NLP, RL) during my self-driven AI specialization program, I believed it was a good idea to go back and visit some of the basics 
such as backprop, dynamic programming, search algorithms and Markov Decision Processes to strengthen my foundation. 

Another motivation for this course selaction was to switch back to compiler based languages and dependency based 
file-structures to re-build my programming fundamentals while working on simpler concepts. So far I've been spending too much time in Jupyter Notebooks and while they are extremely powerful and convenient, they've led me to start to build some bad habits.
