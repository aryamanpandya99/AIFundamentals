CS221: AI Principles and Techniques

Short side projects as I refresh my basic AI techniques and principles. 
As I transition from working on Computer Vision Projects (CS231n, repo ComputerVision) 
to other types of deep learning problems (NLP, RL) during my self-guided master's program, I believed it was a good idea to go back and visit some of the basics 
such as backprop, dynamic programming, search algorithms and Markov Decision Processes to re-build my structural foundation. 

Another reason to work on smaller projects instead of complicated GANs/SegNets etc. was to switch back to compiler based languages and dependency based 
file-structures to re-build my programming fundamentals. So far I'd been spending too much time in Jupyter Notebooks and while they are extremely powerful 
and convenient, they have led me to start to build some bad habits.
