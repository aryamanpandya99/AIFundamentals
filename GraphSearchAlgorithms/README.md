## Graph Search Algorithms

This is the directory in which I'm going to write a bunch of different graph search (shortest path) algorithms in C++. These algorithms have a lot of use in AI applications such as deep search and motion planning for mobile robots. 

To compile and run, use the make file provided. As of now I only have one algorithm implemented, so the program defaults to that. I've set it up so that one executable runs different search algos in this repo sequentially (future iterations will be a bit more interactive). Future commits will also include runtime analyses for comparison and understanding of pros and cons of different shortest path search algorithms.
